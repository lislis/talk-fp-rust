      # Rust is

      --

      - a systems progamming language (like C/ C++)

      --

      - relatively young (1.0.0 was released in 2015)


      --

      - gaining popularity

      ---

      ## Is Rust a functional language?

      --

      No, more like, multi-paradigm and imperative.

      ---

      ## Why are we even here then?

      ---

      background-size: cover

      ---

      ## Two reasons

      --

      1. We can still apply functional thinking non-functional languages

      --

      2. Rust drew inspiration from functional languages

      --

      3.* Rust will be important and knowing it will be useful

      Ready?

      # Disclaimer

      --

      This is not a complete overview of Rust.

      --

      Rust's concepts are not complicated but you need to have them present all at once.

      That can be tough in the beginnning.

      ☐ Immutability

      ☐ Functions

      ☐ Types and Traits

      ☐ Higher Order Functions

      ---

      # (Im)Mutability

      --

      - per default all variables are immutable

      --

      ```rust
      fn main() {

        let a = "hello";
        a = "foo";
      }
      ```

      --

      ```rust
      error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `a`
       --> src/main.rs:4:5
        |
      3 |     let a = "Hello";
        |         - first assignment to `a`
      4 |     a = "foo";
        |     ^^^^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable

      error: aborting due to previous error
      ```
      ---

      # (Im)Mutability

      - per default all variables are immutable

      --

      - but you can opt-into mutability

      --

      ```rust
      fn main() {

        let mut a = "hello";
        a = "foo";
      }
      ```

      ---

      # (Im)Mutability

      - per default all variables are immutable

      - but you can opt-into mutability

      --

      - constants are always immutable

      ```rust
      const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 1000;
      ```

      --

      - _Sidenote_: type annotation on variable assignment is optional

      ---

      # (Im)Mutability .small[pt2]

      --

      - Rust does not implement persistent datastructures

      --

        ➪ copying and allocating large quantities of data comes with performance cost

      --

      - Ownership and the Borrow-checker* take care of a lot of involuntary mutation

      .small[`* both are large topic that are left out in this talk`]

      --

      - there are community efforts ([im-rs](https://github.com/bodil/im-rs))

      - indicated by `fn` keyword

      --

      - a function can have parameters

      --

      - if it has params, types must be annotated

      --

      fn main() {
        id(7);

      ---

      # Statements vs Expressions

      - Statements perform actions

      - Expressions return values

      --

      - Expressions do not have a trailing semicolon

      # Statements vs Expressions .small[pt2]

      --
      - Function declarations are statements

      - Function calls are expressions

      - Statements __cannot__ be assigned to variables, expressions __can__

      # Checklist

      ☑ Immutability

      ☑ Functions

      ☐ Types and Traits

      ☐ Higher Order Functions

      ---

      # Types and Traits

      --

      - Rust is statically typed with type inference

      ---

      # Generic Types and Traits

      --

      - `Generics` are stand-ins for concrete types

      --

      - `Traits` allow implementation of functionality

      --

        - on concrete types

      --

        - on generic types

      --

      ```rust
      impl Log for <T : Debug> {}
      ```

      ---


      # Monads, maybe?

      --

      - `Enums` are types with enumerated possible values

      --

      - `Enum variants` can hold `generic` Types

      --

      ```rust
      enum Option<T> {
        Some<T>,
        None,
      }
      ```

          Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }

      ☑ Immutability

      ☑ Functions

      ☑ Types and Traits

      ☐ Higher Order Functions

      ---

      # Higher Order Functions

      --

      - function names are part of a function's type

      --

        ➪ functions with same signature are still different

      --

        ➪ creating functions dynamically and passing them around is not possible

      --

      - Passing around function pointers??? Probably not

      --

      - fn can't capture environement

      --

      __But__ there is a special case ...


      ---

      # Closures in Rust

      --

      - anonymous functions that can capture values from their context

      --

      - can be saved in variables and used as arguments

      --

      ```rust

      let a_clojure = |num| {
        num * num
      }

      ```
      --

      ```rust
      a_clojure(7)
      ```
      ---

      # Closures in Rust

      - anonymous functions that can capture values from their context

      - can be saved in variables and used as arguments

      - type annotations are optional

      --

      - _Sidenote_: [example implementation of memoization with closures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch13-01-closures.html#storing-closures-using-generic-parameters-and-the-fn-traits)

      ---

      # Enter Iterators

      --

      - `Trait` that handles logic to manage the iteration of a sequence

      - `Iterators` are thread safe

      - `Iterators` are lazy

      --

      ```rust
      let victor = vec!["CA", "CO", "ID", "IN", "IO", "MT", "NY", "SD"];

      let vic_iter = victor.iter();

      ```

      --

      ```rust
      for v in vic_iter {
        println!("{}", v);
      }
      ```

      ---

      # Enter Iterators .small[pt2]

      - can take closures as argument

      --

      - __consuming adaptors__ use up the iterator

      --

      ```rust
      let v1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      let v2 = v1.iter().fold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);
      ```

      --

      - __iterator adaptors__ can transform one iterator into another

      --

      ```rust
      let v1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      let v2 = v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1).fold(0, |acc, x| acc + x);
      ```

      ---

      ## Implementing the Iterator trait
      --

      ```rust
      struct Counter {
        count: u32,
      }

      impl Counter {
        fn new() -> Counter {
          Counter { count: 0 }
        }
      }
      ```

      ## Implementing the Iterator trait .small[pt2]
      --

      impl Iterator for Counter {
        type Item = u32;

        fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
          self.count += 1;

          if self.count < 6 {
            Some(self.count)
          } else {
