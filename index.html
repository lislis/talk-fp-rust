      # Rust is

      --

      - a systems progamming language (like C/ C++)

      --

      - relatively young (1.0.0 was released in 2015)


      --

      - increasingly gaining popularity

      ---

      class: center, middle

      ## Is Rust a functional language?

      --

      # NO!

      ---

      class: center, middle
      ## Why are we even here then?

      ---

      background-image: url(img/shrug2.gif)
      background-size: cover

      ---

      ## Two reasons

      --

      1. Because we can still apply functional thinking non-functional languages

      --

      2. Rust drew inspriation from functional languages

      --

      3.* Rust will be important and knowing it will be useful


      `* one-off error joke`

      ---

      class: center, middle

      Functional programming is not only a paragim,

      but a way of thinking about code

      and a set of tools in your toolbox

      ---

      # How functional can you go?

      --

      Well, let's find out!

      ---

      class: center, middle
      Ready?

      ---

      # Disclaimer

      --

      This is not a complete overview of Rust.

      A lot of important concepts in Rust are left out because they go beyond the scope of this talk.

      But you can ask me after the talk and in the breaks if you want.

      # Checklist

      ☐ Immutability

      ☐ (Pure) Functions

      ☐ Higher Order Functions

      ☐ Monads

      ---

      # (Im)Mutability

      --

      - per default all variables are immutable

      --

      ```rust
      let a = "hello";

      a = "foo";
      ```

      --

      ```rust
      error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `a`
       --> src/main.rs:4:5
        |
      3 |     let a = "Hello";
        |         - first assignment to `a`
      4 |     a = "foo";
        |     ^^^^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable

      error: aborting due to previous error
      ```
      ---

      # (Im)Mutability

      - per default all variables are immutable

      --

      - but you can shadow them

      --

      ```rust
      let a = "hello";

      let a = "foo";
      ```

      ---

      # (Im)Mutability

      - per default all variables are immutable

      - but you can shadow them

      --

      - you have the option to create them mutably

      --

      ```rust
      let mut a = "hello";

      a = "foo";
      ```

      ---

      # (Im)Mutability

      - per default all variables are immutable

      - but you can shadow them

      - you have the option to create them mutably

      - _Sidenote_: type annotation on variable assignment is optional

      ---

      # (Im)Mutability .small[pt2]

      --

      - Rust does not implement persistent datastructures

      --

        ➪ copying and allocating large quantities of data comes with performance cost

      ---


      # Checklist

      ☑ Immutability

      ☐ (Pure) Functions

      ☐ Higher Order Functions

      ☐ Monads

      ---

      # Functions

      --

      - indicated by `fn` keyword

      --

      ```rust
      fn main() {
        println!("Hello World");
      }
      ```

      ---

      # Functions

      - indicated by `fn` keyword

      --

      - a function can have parameters

      --

      - if it has params, types must be annotated

      --

      ```rust
      fn main() {
        another_function(7);
      }

      fn another_function(x: u32) {
        println!("Hello {}", x);
      }
      ```

      ---

      # Functions

      - indicated by `fn` keyword

      - a function can have parameters

      - if it has params, types must be annotated

      --

      - if it returns a value, types must be annotated

      ---

      # Functions .small[continued]

      ```rust
      fn main() {
        println!("Hello {}", another_function(7));
      }

      fn another_function(x: u32) -> u32 {
        x
      }
      ```
      --
      ```bash
      => Hello 7
      ```
      ---

      class: center, middle
      # What does a `fn` return?
      ---

      # Statements vs Expressions
      --

      - Statements perform actions

      - Expressions return values

      --

      - Expressions do not have a trailing semicolon

      ---

      # Statements vs Expressions .small[pt2]

      --
      - Function declarations are statements

      - Function calls are expressions

      --

      - Statements __cannot__ be assigned to variables, expressions __can__

      ---

      # Checklist

      ☑ Immutability

      ☑ (Pure) Functions

      ☐ Higher Order Functions

      ☐ Monads

      ---

      # Higher Order Functions

      --

      - Rust cannot return functions, since declarations are statements

      --

      - Rust cannot take a function as param for the same reason

      --

      __But__ there is a special case ...


      ---

      # Closures in Rust

      --

      - anonymous functions that can capture values form their context

      --

      - can be saved in variables and used as arguments

      --

      ```rust

      let a_clojure = |num| {
        num * num
      }

      ```
      --

      ```rust
      a_clojure(7)
      ```
      ---

      # Closures in Rust

      - anonymous functions that can capture values form their context

      - can be saved in variables and used as arguments

      - type annotations are optional

      --

      - _Sidenote_: [example implementation of memoization with closures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch13-01-closures.html#storing-closures-using-generic-parameters-and-the-fn-traits)

      ---

      # Enter Iterators

      --

      - handles logic to manage the iteration of a sequence

      --

      ```rust
      let victor = vec!["CA", "CO", "ID", "IN", "IO", "MT", "NY", "SD"];

      let vic_iter = victor.inter();

      ```
      ---

      # Enter Iterators

      - handles logic to manage the iteration of a sequence

      - __consuming adaptors__ use up the iterator

      --

      - __iterator adaptors__ can transform one iterator into another

      --

      - can take closures as argument

      --

      ```rust
      let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
      let v2 = v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect();
      ```

      ---

      # Iterators .small[pt2]

      --

      - one of Rust's zero cost abstractions

      --

      - readable high level code

      --

      - implementable on your own types

      ---

      # Checklist

      ☑ Immutability

      ☑ (Pure) Functions

      ☑ Higher Order functions

      ☐ Monads

      ---

      # Monads, maybe?

      --

      enums Option<T> Some(T) None
      enum Result<T, E>, Ok(T) Err(E)


      ---

      ## Is that all there is?

      --

      This is just a small excursion!

      Read [The Rust Programming Language 2nd edition](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/)

      ## Special <3

      to Florian ([@argorak](https://twitter.com/Argorak)) and Andrew ([@andrewhobden](https://twitter.com/andrewhobden))
      for reviewing this talk!

      to Carol ([@carols10cents](https://twitter.com/Carols10cents)) for the amazing work on the [2nd edition Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/)
