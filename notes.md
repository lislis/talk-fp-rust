Who am I


Rust!
  - systems programming language
  - young, yet popular
  - learned from the best
  - strong focus on community and developer happyness (tooling)

Rust is
  - imperative, multi-paradigm

Bring together two worlds
systems programmers who are used to C
higher level programmers who are used to abstractions

Rust as the ultimate language!

Let's explore some of Rust's functional features

Functional Rust

- Immutability, persistent datastructures?

- Types pt 1

    - inference


- Ownership and Borrow

- Functions in Rust

    - Definitions and types

    - Recursion

    - Higher Order Functions

    - Closures

- What is this Iterator thing?

- Types pt2 , Generics and Traits

    - structs, enums

    - traits, generics

    - haskell example

    - derive

    - trait bounds, impl

- Iterators trait

    - lazy

    - thread safe

    - iterator adaptors, consuming adaptors

    - impl!

- Pattern matching

  - Haskell example

  - Standard error handling with Result<T, E>


- Zero cost astractions!
  - amazing type system and
